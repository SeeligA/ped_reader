# PED Reader and PED Writer Notebooks

Two interactive notebooks to analyze and improve machine translation output.

## How are these resources useful?
The Reader notebook uses the post-edit density metric for analyzing and comparing productivity rates across vendors, languages and projects. It can be used on its own or as a reporting solution for the [Woerdle-zehla](https://github.com/SeeligA/woerdle-zehla "woerdle-zehla on GitHub") tool. The notebook helps you to address frequent errors and mistranslation in your MT output in a statistically significant way.

The Writer notebook translates analysis into action. Decrease post-editing efforts by applying search and replace actions directly to your XLIFF files.

## Features:
* Interactive controls for viewing, filtering and visualizing PED data
* Advanced search & replace functions for date formatting, casing and tags.
* Sample data and replacement rules to get you started.

## Use cases for translation services:
* Creating vendor reports based on PED data
* Analyzing MT potential across languages
* Reducing post-editing efforts through search & replace automation

## Requirements
If you are using Anaconda as a package manager, no additional libraries are required. Just make sure that the `source` modules are in your path.
